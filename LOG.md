Hi, here is the log of the development, here you can find ideas before they will or will not be implemented.

 - Crawling websites is not ideal way of aggregating information. Reasons: legality, no official support of data schema (HTML is not frozen), stability (UI may be under DDOS, which may lead to banning crawler IP)
 - Alternative should be contacting owners of the sources and pursuing them to give access to API, if awailable
 - For this short submission, we will still use crawler just for demonstration purposes


Plan for the session:
 - add empty Rails
 - Add docker image, add instructions how to run
 - Add tests on crawler-1
 - Add crawler-1 implementation
 - Add worker to update
 - Add simple results page
 - Add filtration on the page
 - Add crawler-2 tests
 - Add crawler-2 implementation
